#  Automated System for Accurate Detection and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy using AI

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe eye condition that can lead to vision loss in individuals with long-standing diabetes. The prevalence of DR is alarmingly high, and early detection and timely treatment are crucial to prevent severe visual impairment. Traditional methods for DR screening involve manual interpretation of retinal images, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. The increasing incidence of diabetes and the limited number of specialized ophthalmologists further hinder timely and accurate diagnosis.

Current methods for detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy are labor-intensive, subjective, and inconsistent. These limitations lead to delays in diagnosis and intervention, which can result in irreversible vision loss for patients. There is an urgent need for an automated, reliable, and accurate system that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and grading the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy efficiently.


# About Data
The prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy is alarmingly high, affecting a significant proportion of individuals with long-standing diabetes. Early detection and timely treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss and improving patient outcomes. However, manual interpretation of retinal images for Diabetic Retinopathy screening can be time-consuming and subject to human error. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an automated and accurate tool that can assist healthcare professionals in grading the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy.

The existing methods for detecting and grading Diabetic Retinopathy often rely on subjective assessments and extensive manual labor, leading to inefficiencies and potential inconsistencies in diagnosis. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of diabetes and the limited availability of ophthalmologists further exacerbate the challenges in timely screening and diagnosis. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust and reliable automated system that can accurately detect and grade Diabetic Retinopathy, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment plans.


This dataset consists of a large collection of high-resolution retinal images captured under various imaging conditions. A medical professional has assessed the presence of Diabetic Retinopathy in each image and assigned a rating on a scale ranging between 0 and 1, which corresponds to the following categories:

1. Diabetic Retinopathy     --->    0
2. No Diabetic Retinopathy  --->    1

The Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Dataset is a comprehensive collection of 2838 high resolution images divided into two classes

 Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)
 
 No Diabetic Retinopathy(NO DR)
